Claude Collaboration Guide

This folder defines a **structured, step-by-step workflow** for collaborating with Claude Code on this project.

The goal is to:
- avoid scope creep
- keep each iteration small and verifiable
- make AI-assisted development repeatable and debuggable

Think of this as a **versioned task contract** between you and Claude.
